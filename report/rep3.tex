\subsection*{Short review}
Given a domain $D$ enclosed by four curves $\ve{x}_i (p_i), \enspace i = 1,2,3,4,$  
(where $p_i$ are any suitable parameters for the curves)
we want to generate a structured grid on the domain.
For this we define grid parameters $\xi_1 \in [0,1]$ and $\xi_2 \in [0,1]$.
The unit square $R = [0,1]\times[0,1]$ is discretized using 
\begin{align*}
  \xi_{1,i} &= i h_1,\quad i = 0,1,\dots,n, \\
  \xi_{2,j} &= j h_2,\quad j = 0,1,\dots,m.
\end{align*}
where $h_1 = 1/n$ and $h_2 = 1/m$. Define linear interpolation functions $\phi_1(x) = 1$ and
$\phi_2(x) = 1-x$.
Assuming bijective maps $\Phi_1 : [0,1] \mapsto \ve{x}_1(p_1)$ and similarly for the three other
boundaries, the grid may now be generated using the algebraic grid generation formula:
\begin{align*}
  \ve{x}_{ij} &= \phi_2(\xi_{1,i}) \Phi_4 (\xi_{2,j}) + \phi_1(\xi_{1,i}) \Phi_2(\xi_{2,j}) 
  &&\text{[left to right interpolation]}\\
  &\hspace{1mm}+ \phi_2(\xi_{2,j}) \Phi_1(\xi_{1,i}) + \phi_1(\xi_{2,j}) \Phi_3(\xi_{1,i})
  &&\text{[bottom to top interpolation]} \\
  &\hspace{1mm}- \phi_2(\xi_{1,i}) \phi_2(\xi_{2,j}) \Phi_1(0) - 
  \phi_1(\xi_{1,i}) \phi_2(\xi_{2,j}) \Phi_1(1) 
  &&\text{[corrections, corners]}\\
  &\hspace{1mm}- \phi_2(\xi_{1,i}) \phi_1(\xi_{2,j}) \Phi_3(0) -
  \phi_1(\xi_{1,i}) \phi_1(\xi_{2,j}) \Phi_3(1)
  .
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Task 1: The Curvebase class}
In this project we use an abstract class \texttt{Curvebase} to represent curves. The class is written so that it should be easy to derive different classes from \texttt{Curvebase} to represent a wide range of different curves.

We have private virtual functions for determining the value of $x$ and $y$ as well as the derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ for the curve given the user parameter $p$. $p$ is supposed to take values between $a$ and $b$ which are private members of the class. We also have a private member variable called \texttt{length} which is supposed to be the arc length of the curve. 

We have public member functions for determining $x$ and $y$ given the parameter $s$ which is a scaled parameter that goes from $0$ to $1$. To determine the corresponding $x$ and $y$ we use a private member function called \texttt{newtonsolve} which uses Newton's method. To compute the integral of the arc length between two values $a$ and $b$ \texttt{newtonsolve} calls the private function \texttt{integrate}. This function uses the private member functions \texttt{iSimpson} and \texttt{i2Simpson} to compute the integral according to Project 1. 

\subsection*{Task 2: The derived classes}
From the abstract class \texttt{Curvebase} we derived the classes \texttt{xLine}, \texttt{yLine} and \texttt{fxcurve} to be able to create the boundary curves for the desired grid.

\texttt{xLine} is a class that represents curves which has a constant $y$-value. Here we set $a$ to be the initial value of $x$, $b$ the final value of $x$ and length is just set to $b-a$ since we have a straight line. We also have a private variable for the constant $y$-value called $yConst$.

We use $x$ as the used parameter so the private functions for determining the values of $x$ and $y$ and the derivatives just becomes: $x(p)=p$, $y(p)=yConst$, $dx(p)=1$ and $dy(p)=0$.

We also use that we can overwrite the functions for determining $x$ and $y$ given the parameter $s$ since in this special case these values can be computed easily. So we use that $x(s) = a+s*length$ and $y(s) = yConst$. We also use that the arc length integral between $x_1$ and $x_2$ is just $x_2-x_1$.

\texttt{yLine} is a class that represents curves which has a constant $x$-value. For \texttt{yLine} everything looks the same as for \texttt{xLine} but with $x$ and $y$ interchanged everywhere.

Lastly we have the class \texttt{fxcurve}. This is a specific class used to to represent the given lower boundary curve. Here we use $x$ as the user parameter $p$ and then we implemented that $x(p) = p$, $y(p) = f(p)$, $dx(p) = 1$ and $dy(p) = f'(p)$ where $f(\cdot)$ is given in the project description and expression for the derivative was computed analytically.  
 

\subsection*{Task 3: The Domain class}
In this task we designed the class Domain which is a general class for modelling 4-sided domains and structured grids on them. This class takes references to four objects of type \texttt{Curvebase} as arguments to the constructor. The curves represented by these \texttt{Curvebase} objects are then the four sides of the \texttt{Domain}. 


The class \texttt{Domain} has a public member function called \texttt{grid\_generation} which generates a grid according to the algebraic grid generation formula.

\subsection*{Task 4: Writing the grid to a file and plotting it in Matlab}
To be able to write the generated grid to a file we added the public function \texttt{writeFile} to our class \texttt{Domain}. This function opens a binary file and writes first all the $x$-values for the grid points and then the $y$-values for all the grid points before closing the file. 

We then opened the binary file in Matlab and plotted the grid points.
